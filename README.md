# Mohit Yadav's [Personal Website](https://mohityadav.codes)

This is my personal website at the @ and www subdomain of `mohityadav.codes`. This is completely personal and self-designed. I generally shows my portofolio with a link to view my projects website at [`https://sites.mohityadav.codes`](https://sites.mohityadav.codes). If you would like to use as your own website after customizing, refer to [LICENSE.md](https://github.com/SnazzyCoder/personal-website/blob/main/LICENSE.md)

## Status

This website is currently under development, and I would be adding more projects and change it later...
